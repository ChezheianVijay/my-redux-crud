CRUD App with JSON & Redux - Made with ❤️‍🔥 by Loki

Project Description =>

Technology Stack:

React JS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Bootstrap: A front-end framework for responsive design.
React Router (HashRouter): Used for client-side routing to navigate between different pages.
React Redux: A state management library that integrates Redux with React for managing application state.

Pages:

Home Page: The landing page of the app, typically providing an overview or navigation options.
Create Page: A page that allows users to create new items or entries.
Update Page: A page that enables users to update or edit existing items or entries.

Purpose:

To understand and implement state management in a React application using Redux.
To learn how to structure a basic multi-page application with React Router.
To practice integrating UI components using Bootstrap for styling.

Advantages of Using Redux in React JS

Centralized State Management:
Redux provides a single source of truth for the application's state, making it easier to manage and debug.

Predictable State Changes:
By using actions and reducers, Redux ensures that state changes are predictable and transparent, leading to more maintainable code.

Ease of Debugging:
Redux DevTools provide time-travel debugging, allowing developers to inspect changes to the state over time, making it easier to identify issues.

Consistency Across Components:
Redux allows different components to access the same piece of state, ensuring consistency throughout the application.

Enhanced Performance:
By managing the state in a predictable way, Redux can optimize rendering and reduce unnecessary updates, improving the overall performance of the application.

Flexibility with Middleware:
Redux supports middleware, enabling powerful capabilities like asynchronous actions, logging, error handling, and more.

Scalable Architecture:
Redux’s architecture supports large-scale applications by making it easy to extend and maintain as the application grows.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
